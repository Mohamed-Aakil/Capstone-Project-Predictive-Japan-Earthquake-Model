# Data Acquisition and Pre-Processing Report

<b>Identifying Data</b>
<b>Data Sources:</b>
The data that we are looking for our model should be related to the earthquakes that have occurred in the
due period, near the area surrounding Japan. For this reason, we have surfed through the internet and
concluded that a government agency named “United States Geological Survey (USGS)”, will be our
starting and reliable point of data collection. The official website is: usgs.gov

<b>Acquisition Process:</b>
<b>We have followed the following steps collecting the data we required:</b>
-<b>Step 1:</b> We navigated through the website home > Earthquakes > Search Earthquake Catalog.
-<b>Step 2:</b> We then set the parametric criteria for our data. For example, Magnitude is set to 4.5+ and data
has been set to custom, and we then marked the area on the map provided by website where we wanted to
have the records of earthquake happening.

-<b>Step 3:</b> We then downloaded the JSON files in batches of Time Period slots. We divided the period in
1900-2023 into [“1900-1909”, “1910-1939”, “1940-1969”, “1970-1999”, “2000-2023”], because we
faced issues while downloading data as single batch, due to large memory.

Shown below is a sample JSON of a single earthquake with its properties.

-<b>C.Output:</b> What are you trying to predict?  Define the output clearly. 
- The goal is to predict the magnitude of the next earthquake. The target variable for our predictive modeling task is the magnitude of the earthquake.

- Predicting the magnitude of an earthquake can contribute to the development of early warning systems. While it might not be possible to predict earthquakes with perfect accuracy, identifying patterns that precede larger magnitudes can provide valuable seconds to minutes of warning, allowing for emergency response actions and potentially saving lives.
- Understanding the potential magnitude of earthquakes in a region is crucial for risk assessment and mitigation strategies. Engineers and city planners can use this information to design structures that can withstand seismic activity, and authorities can establish building codes and regulations to minimize the impact of earthquakes on communities.

<b>2. Predictive Models</b>

A.What are the methods?  Give a general introduction of the methods with references
-<b>Gradient Boosting:</b> Gradient boosting is a powerful machine learning technique used for building predictive models, particularly in regression and classification tasks. It belongs to the ensemble learning methods, where multiple models are combined to create a stronger model. Unlike bagging methods like Random Forest, which build independent models in parallel, gradient boosting builds models sequentially, with each new model focusing on correcting the errors made by the previous ones.
-<b>Basic Idea:</b> Gradient boosting builds an ensemble of weak learners (often decision trees) in a sequential manner, where each new weak learner is trained to correct the errors of the ensemble so far. It combines these weak learners to create a strong predictive model.
-<b>Sequential Learning:</b> Unlike bagging methods, which build models independently, gradient boosting builds models sequentially. Each new model is trained on the residuals (the differences between the actual and predicted values) of the previous models.
-<b>Loss Function Optimization:<b> Gradient boosting minimizes a loss function, such as mean squared error for regression or cross-entropy loss for classification, by iteratively adding new models that reduce the loss.
-<b>Gradient Descent:</b> The "gradient" in gradient boosting refers to the gradient of the loss function with respect to the predictions of the current ensemble. The new weak learner is trained to minimize the loss by following the negative gradient direction.
</b>Regularization:</b> Gradient boosting often includes regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, such as tree constraints (e.g., maximum depth, minimum samples per leaf), shrinkage (learning rate), and subsampling of the data.
<b>Hyperparameter Tuning:</b> Gradient boosting involves tuning hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, number of trees, and tree-specific parameters, to optimize the model's performance.
<b>Popular Implementations:</b> There are several popular implementations of gradient boosting, including XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, which are widely used in practice due to their efficiency and effectiveness.

<b>Neural Networks:</b> Neural networks are computational models inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain, capable of learning complex patterns and relationships from data. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized into layers, with each layer processing information and passing it to the next layer. During training, neural networks adjust their weights and biases based on the error between predicted and true outputs, using optimization algorithms like gradient descent. Activation functions introduce non-linearity to the network, allowing it to learn complex relationships. Various types of neural networks exist, including feedforward neural networks (FNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and recurrent neural networks (RNN), each suited to different types of data and tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and sequential data analysis. Deep learning, a subfield of neural networks, has revolutionized many fields due to its ability to automatically learn hierarchical representations of data.
Support Vector Machines (SVMs): SVMs are powerful supervised machine learning models used for classification and regression tasks. They are particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and when the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples. SVMs are widely used in fields such as bioinformatics, text mining, image recognition, and more.
At its core, an SVM performs classification by finding the hyperplane that best separates different classes in feature space. This hyperplane is chosen in such a way that it maximizes the margin between the classes, which is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data point from each class, also known as support vectors.

 - In this case, the architecture of the neural network consists of multiple hidden layers, allowing it to learn intricate patterns in the seismic data.
 - The Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 is chosen for efficient convergence during training.
   
<b>Support Vector Machines:</b>
<b>Strengths:</b>
 - Can handle both linear and nonlinear classification and regression tasks through the use of different kernel functions, making them suitable for a wide range of real-world problems.
 - They are robust against overfitting, especially when using appropriate regularization techniques, ensuring stable performance across different datasets.
 - SVMs use only a subset of training points (support vectors) to define the decision boundary, making them memory efficient, particularly for large datasets.
 - SVMs have a solid theoretical foundation in convex optimization, ensuring convergence to the global minimum and providing a clear understanding of their behavior, which justifies their use in various machine learning applications.
<b>ustification</b>:
 - SVMs exhibit strong predictive accuracy, making them a popular choice for classification and regression tasks where high performance is crucial.
 - SVMs naturally handle high-dimensional data and complex relationships between features, allowing them to effectively capture patterns and make accurate predictions in real-world scenarios.
 - SVMs have been successfully applied to various domains, including image classification, text categorization, and bioinformatics, demonstrating their versatility and effectiveness in solving diverse machine learning problems.

<b>Model Evaluation:</b>
- The choice of models is further justified by evaluating them using metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE) on the test set.
- Both models are trained and evaluated on the same data set, allowing for a fair comparison of their performance.
- The models' performance is assessed based on how well they minimize the prediction error and generalize to unseen data.
Overall, the choice of Gradient Boosting Regressor and Neural Network is justified by their ability to capture complex patterns in the data and their strong predictive performance, as evidenced by the evaluation metrics. Moreover, the use of grid search for hyperparameter tuning ensures that the models are optimized for the given dataset. We also wanted to experiment with the basics of neural networks, and that is why we deliberately included this as one of the models that we wanted to include as predictive models for this. 
3. Evaluations
A.What metrics do you use for evaluation?  
oThe choice of models is further justified by evaluating them using metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE) on the test set.
oBoth models are trained and evaluated on the same data set, allowing for a fair comparison of their performance.
oThe models' performance is assessed based on how well they minimize the prediction error and generalize to unseen data.

oNeural Nets:

<b>Gradient Boosting Regressor:</b>

-<b>Support Vector Machines (SVM)</b>

<img width="640" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/458eab5b-c07e-4eb8-93a5-42aaad35b78c">

- From the above results, we can see that Neural Nets has taken more time than Gradient Boosting Regressor and SVM. The time taken is like around 3 times faster than Neural Nets and 5 times faster than SVM. Although the RMSE of Neural Nets and Gradient Boosting are pretty much the same, the SVM’s RMSE is higher.

B.What is your ground truth? 
- The ground truth in our analysis refers to the observed or actual values of the target variable in our dataset. In the context of our predictive modeling task, the ground truth represents the true outcomes or measurements that we aim to predict using our model. It serves as the basis for evaluating the performance of our model and assessing how well it aligns with the actual data. Essentially, the ground truth provides a reference point against which we compare the predictions generated by our model to determine its accuracy and effectiveness. To be more precise, the test values of Magnitude are our ground truth values, which are the values of magnitudes of earthquakes that actually happened on that particular area. 

C.Discuss the performance and the limitations of the method.
- Gradient Boosting Regressor:
<b>Sensitivity to Noisy Data:</b>
  - Like other tree-based algorithms, Gradient Boosting Regressor can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers. It may try to fit the noise in the data, leading to overfitting.
    
<b>Computational Complexity:</b>
oGradient Boosting Regressor can be computationally expensive and time-consuming to train, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex models with many trees.

<b>Hyperparameter Sensitivity:</b>
- Gradient Boosting Regressor has several hyperparameters that need to be tuned, such as the learning rate, number of trees, tree depth, and regularization parameters. Finding the optimal combination of hyperparameters can require extensive experimentation and computational resources.

<b>Potential for Overfitting:</b>
- Gradient Boosting Regressor is susceptible to overfitting, especially when the model is too complex or when the learning rate is too high. Overfitting can occur if the model captures noise or irrelevant patterns in the training data, leading to poor generalization performance on unseen data.

<b>Limited Interpretability:</b>
- While Gradient Boosting Regressor can provide accurate predictions, it is often considered a black-box model, making it challenging to interpret how individual features contribute to the predictions. Understanding the internal workings of the model and extracting insights from it may be difficult.

<b>Scalability:</b>
- Gradient Boosting Regressor may not scale well to very large datasets or distributed computing environments. Training the model on large datasets may require significant computational resources and memory.

<b>Gradient Descent Approach:</b>
 - Gradient Boosting Regressor relies on the gradient descent optimization algorithm, which may get stuck in local minima or plateaus, especially if the objective function is non-convex. This can affect the model's ability to find the optimal global solution.

<b>Neural Nets:</b>
<b>Complexity and Interpretability:</b>
oNeural Networks, especially deep neural networks, are highly complex models with multiple layers of interconnected neurons. While they can capture complex patterns in the data, understanding how the model makes predictions can be challenging due to their black-box nature.

<b>Overfitting:</b>
oNeural Networks are prone to overfitting, especially when the model architecture is complex or when the training dataset is small. Techniques such as regularization, dropout, and early stopping are commonly used to mitigate overfitting in neural networks.

<b>Training Time and Computational Resources:</b>
oTraining deep neural networks can be computationally intensive and time-consuming, especially for large datasets or complex architectures. Training neural networks may require access to high-performance computing resources such as GPUs or TPUs.

<b>Data Requirements:</b>
oNeural Networks typically require a large amount of training data to learn complex patterns effectively. Training a neural network with insufficient data may result in poor generalization performance and overfitting.

<b>Hyperparameter Tuning:</b>
- Neural Networks have various hyperparameters, including the number of layers, the number of neurons per layer, activation functions, and learning rates. Tuning these hyperparameters to optimize performance requires experimentation and computational resources.

<b>SVM:</b>
<b>Insufficient Data:</b> 
 - SVMs perform better when trained on a large amount of data. If the dataset is too small or lacks diversity, the model may fail to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
   
<b>Imbalanced Data:</b> 
 - When classes in the dataset are imbalanced (i.e., one class significantly outnumbers the others), SVM may prioritize the majority class and perform poorly on the minority class(es).
   
<b>Non-linear Relationships:</b> 
 - SVM is inherently a linear classifier. If the relationship between features and the target variable is non-linear, SVM may fail to capture this complex relationship without appropriate kernel functions or feature engineering.
   
<b>Incorrect Choice of Kernel:</b> 
 - The choice of kernel function in SVM significantly impacts its performance. If the wrong kernel is chosen or the hyperparameters of the kernel are not tuned properly, the model may fail to generalize well to unseen data.

<b>Overfitting or Underfitting:</b> 
oSVM models are susceptible to overfitting if the model complexity is too high or underfitting if the model complexity is too low. Regularization parameters (C in linear SVM and C, gamma in kernel SVM) need to be tuned properly to avoid these issues.

</b>Noise in Data:</b> 
oIf the dataset contains noise or irrelevant features, SVM may learn from these noisy patterns and fail to generalize well to unseen data.

<b>Feature Scaling:</b> 
- SVM performance can be sensitive to the scale of features. If features are not properly scaled, with some having much larger ranges than others, it can affect the decision boundary and lead to suboptimal performance.

<b>Outliers:</b> 
- Outliers can significantly impact the decision boundary learned by SVM. If outliers are not properly handled or removed, they can skew the decision boundary and lead to poor predictions.

<b>Model Complexity:</b>
 - SVM may struggle with highly complex datasets where the decision boundary is not easily separable by a hyperplane. In such cases, more sophisticated models or ensemble methods may be more suitable.

<b>Data Leakage:</b> 
 - If there is any form of data leakage present in the dataset, where information from the test set leaks into the training process, the model may perform well on the test set but fail to generalize to new, unseen data.
